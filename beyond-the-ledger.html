                <h3 class="neon-subtitle">The Genesis: a conversation in Zurich</h3>
                <p>The spark for this research was not found in a financial white paper but in a passing conversation with Professor Claudio Tessone during the 2025 summer school at the University of Zurich. He shared the story of the **CheeseChain project**; a narrative that immediately intrigued me because it was not about speculative assets, but an effort to protect the integrity of a Swiss protected-designation cheese supply chain by combining biological authentication with a tamper‑evident digital audit trail (UZH Communication Systems Group, n.d.).</p>
                <br>
                <p>CheeseChain focuses on the Tête‑de‑Moine PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) value chain and combines a DNA‑based intrinsic product authentication approach with a blockchain‑based audit trail to improve transparency and verifiability across the chain (UZH Communication Systems Group, n.d.). The project notes that the Interprofession Tête‑de‑Moine has used a proof‑of‑origin culture developed by Agroscope since 2013 (UZH Communication Systems Group, n.d.). Agroscope has also developed proof-of-origin cultures to combat counterfeiting; these cultures are used to protect Swiss cheeses including Tête de Moine PDO (Bachmann et al., 2019).</p>
                <br>
                <p>This question of “provenance that travels” matters because proof of origin doesn’t always “travel” easily across borders. Legal protections for names and origin can vary by jurisdiction. For example, a U.S. appellate dispute over the term “gruyere” shows how a cheese name tied to a specific place in one context can be treated as a generic label in another (USPTO, 2024).</p>
                <br>
                
                <h3 class="neon-subtitle">What is blockchain, really?</h3>
                <p>To appreciate why blockchain can be a useful tool for food security, one must first strip away the hype and view it as a fundamental innovation in record-keeping. At its core, a blockchain is a shared, immutable digital ledger (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Unlike a traditional database, a blockchain is distributed across a network of participants known as nodes. This decentralised structure ensures that no single party can manipulate the “truth” for their own benefit (Nakamoto, 2008).</p>
                <br>
                <p>This architecture relies on three specific technical pillars:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shared visibility (Transparency):</strong> authorised participants can access the same underlying record, reducing costly data mismatches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tamper‑evident history (Immutability):</strong> records are linked so that altering past entries is detectable (Nakamoto, 2008).</li>
                    <li><strong>Agreement on updates (Consensus):</strong> new entries are added through agreed rules, reducing reliance on a single intermediary (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3 class="neon-subtitle">Connecting the dots: friction, loss, and exclusion</h3>
                <p>The Swiss story was so intriguing that I began to explore how this logic applies to other friction-heavy systems. I thought to myself: “If provenance can protect value in a high-end Swiss supply chain, what could it do where decentralised truth can build agency at scale?”. I initially considered how blockchain might reduce corruption or prevent agricultural waste. However, the true gravity of agricultural loss in Africa only became clear to me later in October 2025 while working on a project regarding **crop receipts**.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It was during this period that the abstract concept of supply chain friction became a visible reality of systemic waste and financial exclusion. I gained direct insight into the staggering scale of post-harvest loss where globally FAO estimates that roughly 14% of food is lost from post‑harvest up to retail (FAO, 2019). Separately, UNEP estimates that in 2022 the world wasted 1.05 billion tonnes of food (UNEP, 2024).</p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="neon-subtitle">Call to Action: Identifying the Friction</h3>
                <p>The evidence from Swiss protected-origin cheeses to large retailer traceability pilots suggests that the most durable value of blockchain is decentralised provenance: a shared, tamper‑evident audit trail that multiple parties can rely on (Hyperledger, n.d.).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ask yourself: Which processes in your sector are slowed down by poor verification or fragmented data? If the bottleneck is trust in the record, an immutable, shared audit trail may be a practical part of the solution.</p>
