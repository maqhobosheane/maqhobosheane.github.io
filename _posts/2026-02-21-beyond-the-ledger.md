### The Genesis: a conversation in Zurich

[cite_start]The spark for this research was not found in a financial white paper but in a passing conversation with Professor Claudio Tessone during the 2025 summer school at the University of Zurich[cite: 171]. [cite_start]He shared the story of the **CheeseChain project**; a narrative that immediately intrigued me because it was not about speculative assets—the most commonly discussed application of blockchain—but an effort to protect the integrity of a Swiss protected-designation cheese supply chain by combining biological authentication with a tamper‑evident digital audit trail[cite: 172].

[cite_start]CheeseChain focuses on the Tête‑de‑Moine PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) value chain and combines a DNA‑based intrinsic product authentication approach with a blockchain‑based audit trail to improve transparency and verifiability across the chain[cite: 173]. [cite_start]The project notes that the Interprofession Tête‑de‑Moine has used a proof‑of‑origin culture developed by Agroscope since 2013[cite: 174]. [cite_start]Agroscope has also developed proof-of-origin cultures to combat counterfeiting; these cultures are used to protect Swiss cheeses including Tête de Moine PDO[cite: 174].

[cite_start]This question of “provenance that travels” matters because proof of origin—who made a product, where, and under what standards—doesn’t always “travel” easily across borders[cite: 175]. [cite_start]Legal protections for names and origin can vary by jurisdiction[cite: 175]. [cite_start]For example, a U.S. appellate dispute over the term “gruyere” shows how a cheese name tied to a specific place in one context can be treated as a generic label in another[cite: 176].

### What is blockchain, really?

[cite_start]To appreciate why blockchain can be a useful tool for food security, one must first strip away the hype and view it as a fundamental innovation in record-keeping[cite: 185]. [cite_start]At its core, a blockchain is a **shared, immutable digital ledger**[cite: 185, 186]. [cite_start]Unlike a traditional database, where a central authority like a bank or a government agency has the power to modify or delete entries, a blockchain is distributed across a network of participants known as nodes[cite: 186]. [cite_start]This decentralised structure ensures that no single party can manipulate the “truth” for their own benefit[cite: 186].

This architecture relies on three specific technical pillars:

- [cite_start]**Shared visibility (Transparency)**: authorised participants can access the same underlying record, reducing costly data mismatches[cite: 189].
- [cite_start]**Tamper‑evident history (Immutability)**: records are linked so that altering past entries is detectable, creating an audit trail[cite: 190].
- [cite_start]**Agreement on updates (Consensus)**: new entries are added through agreed rules, reducing reliance on a single intermediary[cite: 191].

[cite_start]In agrifood systems, these properties translate into **operational memory**: when goods move from farm to warehouse to market, hand‑offs and checks can be logged in a way that is easier to verify across organisations and jurisdictions[cite: 192].

### Connecting the dots: friction, loss, and exclusion

The Swiss story was so intriguing that I began to explore how this logic applies to other friction-heavy systems. I thought to myself: _“If provenance can protect value in a high-end Swiss supply chain, what could it do where decentralised truth can build agency at scale?”_ I initially considered how blockchain might reduce corruption within governments or prevent agricultural waste. However, the true gravity of agricultural frictions in Africa only became clear to me later in October 2025 while working on a project regarding **crop receipts**.

It was during this period that the abstract concept of supply chain friction became a visible reality of systemic waste and financial exclusion. [cite_start]I gained direct insight into the staggering scale of post-harvest loss where globally FAO estimates that roughly **14% of food is lost** from post‑harvest up to (but excluding) retail[cite: 180]. [cite_start]Separately, UNEP estimates that in 2022 the world wasted **1.05 billion tonnes of food**—about one‑fifth (19%) of food available to consumers—at retail, food service, and household level[cite: 181].

[cite_start]At the same time, many smallholder farmers struggle to access finance because they cannot document production, sales, and performance in forms lenders can readily verify[cite: 182]. [cite_start]GSMA frames this as part of a broader smallholder finance challenge, noting a **$170 billion funding gap** for smallholder farmers and highlighting how verifiable farmer records can support credit scoring and access to finance[cite: 183].

### A core case for food systems: traceability and coordination

[cite_start]Sub‑Saharan Africa’s agrifood markets are often fragmented, with many small producers and intermediaries[cite: 194]. [cite_start]IFAD notes that smallholder farmers account for up to **80% of production in Sub‑Saharan Africa** and parts of Asia, underscoring how system performance depends on linking large numbers of small actors to reliable markets and services[cite: 195].

[cite_start]Food insecurity is not only a problem of production; it is often also a problem of information and coordination[cite: 196]. [cite_start]When supply chains are opaque, paperwork and verification delays can keep perishables stationary, and when disputes arise, parties may lack a shared record to resolve them quickly[cite: 197].

### Waste reduction through faster, more targeted traceability

Traceability matters most when something goes wrong. [cite_start]In its blockchain pilots, Walmart reported that tracing the provenance of mangoes went from nearly seven days to **2.2 seconds** once key data were recorded and retrievable via its blockchain‑based traceability system[cite: 199]. [cite_start]The same case study notes that better traceability can allow companies to discard produce from affected farms rather than entire categories, reducing unnecessary waste during food‑safety events[cite: 200].

### Operational gains: an example from East Africa

[cite_start]Digital logistics platforms can also reduce friction in everyday distribution[cite: 202]. [cite_start]Twiga Foods’ work with Google Cloud describes automating its order‑to‑dispatch process and using route optimisation tools; the release reports a **40% reduction in delivery costs** linked to these tools[cite: 204]. [cite_start]While this example is not itself a blockchain deployment, it illustrates the broader point: better, faster data flows can translate into lower logistics costs and less spoilage by improving coordination[cite: 205].

Not every fix needs a blockchain. The point is verifiable, shareable data; blockchains are most useful when multiple parties need to trust the same record without a single controlling intermediary. In settings where farmers, aggregators, lenders, and regulators need to rely on the same provenance and performance records, that design choice can matter.

### Empowering smallholders: verifiable records as a basis for finance

[cite_start]A less visible but potentially more profound use case is financial inclusion[cite: 207]. [cite_start]Where farmers operate informally, the problem is often not a lack of productivity but a lack of verifiable records that lenders can use[cite: 208]. [cite_start]GSMA highlights blockchain’s potential role in storing and verifying farmer records (e.g., household data, transaction histories, procurement records) that can then inform credit scoring and expand access to finance[cite: 209].

### Call to action: find the friction-heavy processes

[cite_start]The evidence from Swiss protected-origin cheeses to large retailer traceability pilots suggests that the most durable value of blockchain is not speculation, but **decentralised provenance**: a shared, tamper‑evident audit trail that multiple parties can rely on[cite: 211].

[cite_start]For leaders, the practical question is where mistrust, duplicated paperwork, or hard‑to‑verify claims are costing time and capital[cite: 212]. [cite_start]The logic extends beyond food: shipping is moving toward electronic trade documents, and Hapag‑Lloyd describes rolling out electronic bills of lading (eBL) to reduce reliance on paper workflows[cite: 213].

[cite_start]Ask yourself: **Which processes in your sector are slowed down by poor verification, fragmented data, or repeated reconciliation?** If the bottleneck is trust in the record, an immutable, shared audit trail may be a practical part of the solution[cite: 215].

If you’re curious about where blockchain genuinely adds value (and where it doesn’t), the Zurich Deep Dive into Blockchain summer school is a practical way to explore it. You start with the basics, test some use cases, and work toward shaping a project idea of your own. If that sounds useful, [apply here](https://www.summerschools.uzh.ch/en/apply-now.html).
